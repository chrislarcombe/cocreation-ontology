# Co-creation Ontology

An ontology for universal co-creation (assembed 2012-2016). The 7 frequencies can be used to faclitate global collaboration and co-creation, independent of culture and language. The words used to define each of the 7 frequencies may vary between cultures, but the phenomena of co-creation is the same and the frequencies therefore equally apply.

This document and the symbols used in the ontology can be translated into each human language. The ontology is then able to connect all human beings in such a way as to faclitate collaboration and co-creation universally.
